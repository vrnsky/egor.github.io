This year, I read the following books:

### Art of Statistics, David Spiegelhalter

The book opens for me in a way that the information you bring is important.
Massive media information sometimes speculates on the statistics.

### Good with Words, Patrick Barry

A very detailed book made me think about how I communicate in writing 
and how I can improve it.

### Cloud Native Spring in Action, Thomas Vitale
This book provides a very good basis for modern development techniques. 
From this book, I get an overview of how cloud-native projects should look.
