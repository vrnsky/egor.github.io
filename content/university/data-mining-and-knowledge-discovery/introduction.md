### What is data mining?

Data mining is a process that uses various data analysis tools to discover 
patterns and relationships in data that can be used to make valid predictions.

It involves:
- Understanding business/research problems
- Collecting and preparing data
- Analyzing data to find patterns
- Building predictive models

Evaluating CRISP-DM Methodology - the standard process for data mining projects follows these phases:
- Business understanding: Clarifying objectives and requirements
- Data understanding: Exploring data to identify quality issues and insights
- Data preparation: Cleaning and transformation data for analysis
- Modeling: Applying various data mining techniques
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance
- Deployment: Implementing the solution

### Key concepts
Types of data mining tasks:
- Classification (prediction categories)
- Regression (prediction numerical values)
- Clustering (grouping similar items)
- Association analysis (finding relationships)

### Data understanding and preparation
- Data types (categorical, numerical, etc)
- Data quality issues (missing values, outliers)
- Data transformation techniques
- Feature selection

### Model evaluation
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Validation techniques
- Avoiding overfitting/underfitting
