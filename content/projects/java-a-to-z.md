### Project description
Study project which was created during my studying on [Job4j](https://job4j.ru/). The course covers basic Java, Git, and other skills required for Java Junior Developers.

The project is now in maintenance mode - no more features, except new must-haves for Java Junior Developers.

Source code available on [Github](https://github.com/vrnsky/java-a-to-z)
